# System Programming in Linux

This document provides an introduction to the System Programming in Linux repository, which contains several shell implementations and Linux utility programs demonstrating various approaches to command processing, memory management, and system call usage in Linux.

The repository serves as a practical example of how to implement shell functionality and basic Linux utilities using system calls and low-level programming techniques.

For detailed information about specific shell implementations, see [Shell Implementations.](https://deepwiki.com/mmmmm222/System-Programming-in-Linux/2-shell-implementations)


Repository Structure
### The repository contains two main categories of programs:

1. **Shell Implementations - Three shells of varying complexity:**

- Pico Shell - Simplest implementation with static and dynamic allocation versions
- Nano Shell - Adds variable management capabilities
- Micro Shell - Adds I/O redirection support

2. **Linux Utilities - Custom implementations of basic Linux utilities:**

- zcp - File copy utility
- zcat - File output utility
- zecho - Text echo utility
- zmv - File move utility
